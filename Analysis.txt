I ran out code on the server and from all the data gathered I recognize these information:

	1) The number of messages received in Broadcast communication is always 100, which is as expected.
			Because all the nodes after sending 100 messages will not attempt more, but still wait to receive the termination
			order from node 0.
			
	2) The number of messages received in Multicast communication is not exact but, usually around 500, which shows that
			the random chosen nodes for sending a message is uniformly distributed.
			
	3) Always the number of messages received is equal to the number of messages buffered and those not buffered.
	
	4) The standard deviation of latencies for this amount of artificial delay is not predictable, but if we increase the
			artificial delay so that to be much bigger than the actual propagation delay it would be a function of that.
			
	5) In most of the nodes the Average Letency (+/- Deviation) is around the MAXIMUM Buffer time which shows that the buffer
			time relates to the messages causally related.
