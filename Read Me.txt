I wrote my code in Java. It can be easily executed from the CS-6378-Project-I directory by the following command:
		
		'java [-cp .] ProgramLogic.Main <NODE_ID> [options]'
		
	Options are:
			--help			To show the help of the program
			--broadcast		To execute the progarm as broadcast (the default is Multicast)
			
Anyone can execute the scripts on the windows through plink as follows using the scripts I added:

	Multicast:
		start plink -ssh <NET_ID>@dc30.utdallas.edu <-pw "PASSWORD" / Using Certificates> -batch <address to CS-6378-Project-I>/Scripts/Process-<i>-Multicast.sh
	
	Broadcast:
		start plink -ssh <NET_ID>@dc30.utdallas.edu <-pw "PASSWORD" / Using Certificates> -batch <address to CS-6378-Project-I>/Scripts/Process-<i>-Broadcast.sh
		
		
Or if you want to run on Linux platform:
	
	Do the same via ssh directly.
